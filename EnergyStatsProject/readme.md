## Data Source 
- Energy consumption and production statistics data has been provided by United Nations Statistics, a division on the UN Data site and it is available on Kaggle for data science projects

## Goals of this Project
- Explore the data to find out Crude Oil imports and production for the G7 group countries
- Find out insights for the Nuclear Electricity for the G7 group countries
- Explore the alternative energy resource usage and generation such as Wind Energy, Solar Energy, Tidal Wave and Ocean Energy for the G7 group countries
- Overall the focus is on finding out the insights for various energy usage and generation
