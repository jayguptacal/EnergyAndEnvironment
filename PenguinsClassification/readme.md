## Introduction
<p>Scientists have been collecting data on the Palmer archipelago, Antarctica for the different type of penguins. You can read more about this data here as data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman (https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER (https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network (https://lternet.edu/).

Thank you to Dr. Gorman, Palmer Station LTER and the LTER Network! Special thanks to Marty Downs (Director, LTER Network Office) for help regarding the data license & use.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to use the Decision Tree, a supervised learning algorithm to identify the correct penguin species based on the penguin features.</p>

## Problem Identification and Data Features Description

Hypothesis: Identify and predict a penguin species utilizing Decision Tree, a supervised machine learning algorithm based on the prenguin features.

Context for Penguins Species Identification: As part of their scientific studies, scientists in Antartica are identifying penguin species and monitoring their population. By taking their measurements of features such as weight, body length, beak length etc, scientists are tyring to predict correct penguin species based on using a machine learning algorithm.
