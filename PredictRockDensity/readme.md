The main goal is to predict rock density based on the X-ray signal strength using a variety of machine learning algorithms so that tunnel boring machine cutter head could be decided and planned proactively. While building this model, we can use a variety of machine learning algorithms and decide which one would be the best option.

Here is the summary of machine learning algorithms which will be used on this project:

- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- KNN Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- AdaBoost Regressor
