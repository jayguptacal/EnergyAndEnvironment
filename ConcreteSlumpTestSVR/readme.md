As per wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_slump_test), the concrete slump test measures the consistency of fresh concrete before it sets. It is performed to check the workability of freshly made concrete, and therefore the ease with which concrete flows. It can also be used as an indicator of an improperly mixed batch. The test is popular due to the simplicity of apparatus used and simple procedure. The slump test is used to ensure uniformity for different loads of concrete under field conditions.

Accordingly, its slump rating indicates what construction application the concrete is good for. The higher the slump, the more workable the concrete.

Concrete is composed of four main ingredients: cement, water, fine aggregate (sand), and coarse aggregate (rock). Recycled cementitious materials such as slag and fly ash are also substituted for cement, to provide varying effects on the concreteâ€™s plastic and hardened properties.

The main purpose of this project is to use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression Modeling, a supervised learning algorithm to simulate compressive strength of the concrete.
