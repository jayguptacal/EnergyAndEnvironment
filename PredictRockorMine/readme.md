## Introduction
<p>Prior to machine learning usage, a visual as well as laboratory identification was required to identify if we are dealing with a rock or a metal mine. These explosive mines were placed in the seabed under the water to destroy war ships during the war time. As you can imagine, these explosive mines are a real serious threat to safety of ocean traffic as well as to marine life.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) supervised learning algorithm to identify the difference between normal rocks and explosive mines based on the response data received from the sonar signal. </p>

## Problem Identification and Data Features Description

Hypothesis: Identify and predict a rock or an explosive mine based on the sonar data available utilizing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) supervised machine learning algorithm

Context for Sonar Usage: Sonar (sound navigation ranging) is a technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water, such as other vessels.

Data Source: In order to support machine learning algorithm, UCI Machine Learning Respository has made the data available for specific to this purpose which will be utilized for this project.
